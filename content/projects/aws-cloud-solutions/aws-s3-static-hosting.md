📝 **Project Overview**  
In this project, I deployed a fully functional static website using Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service). This task introduced me to cloud-based storage, object permissions, and static site hosting—core skills for cloud computing and web deployment.

---

🎯 **Objectives**
- Learn how to create and configure an S3 bucket  
- Upload and serve static content (HTML, CSS)  
- Set object-level permissions for public access  
- Enable static website hosting on S3  

---

🛠️ **Tools & Technologies**
- Amazon S3  
- HTML / CSS  

---

## 🧪 Steps Followed

### 1. Created an S3 Bucket
- Named the bucket with a unique name  
- Disabled “Block all public access” to allow website visitors  

---

### 2. Uploaded Website Files
Files included:
- `index.html`: Homepage  
- `style.css`: Page styling  
- `error.html`: Custom 404 error page

### 4. Set Bucket Policy for Public Access

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": "*",
    "Action": "s3:GetObject",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::brianscloudcraft/*"
  }]
}
```

---

### 5. Accessed the Live Site
Used the S3 website endpoint URL to access the live static website
