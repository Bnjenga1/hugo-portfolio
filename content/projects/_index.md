Welcome to my project portfolio. Here, you'll find a curated selection of work spanning **Data Analysis**, **AWS Cloud Solutions**, and **Web Scraping**. Each category showcases hands-on, real-world projects that reflect my skills in Python, R, cloud computing, and data-driven decision making. Whether itâ€™s forecasting air quality, automating AWS cost insights, or extracting insights from web data, these projects demonstrate both technical depth and practical impact.
